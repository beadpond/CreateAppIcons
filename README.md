CreateAppIcons
==============

This is an adaptation of a Photoshop script to make iOS app icons. The change builds on the icons by adding other sizes for common square icons. The goal is to make an easy and quick way for Corona SDK developers or anyone to make these icon files from a single 1024x1024 png file.
